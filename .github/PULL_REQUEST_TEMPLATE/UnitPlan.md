- [ ] **Unit Test Plan Review**
  - [ ] **General**
    - [ ]  Does the test plan specify the objectives, entry criteria and exit criteria for testing?
    - [ ]  Does the test plan identify and specify all equipment, software tools and any other resources required for testing? (Or provide reference to where these are specified.)
    - [ ]  Does the test plan specify the test environment - hardware, software, OS, simulation, etc?
    - [ ]  Have you considered optimization of resources (hardware, software, OS etc)?
    - [ ]  Are risks associated with testing identified in the test plan or in the project plan?
    - [ ]  Are dependencies for the test activity identified in the test plan or in the project plan?
    - [ ]  Does the test plan identify what test tools, scripts, batch files, etc. are to be developed for testing?
    - [ ]  Are all required test topologies identified and described in the test plan?
    - [ ]  Does the test plan (or project plan) specify how faults detected by testing are recorded?\
    - [ ]  Does the test plan specify how regression testing will be done?
    - [ ]  Does the test plan (or the project plan) identify how test records will be maintained?
    - [ ]  Is the minimum acceptable test coverage for each module stated quantitatively in the test plan?
    - [ ]  Has the updated RTM been sent as part of UTP for review? (RTM should also be a part of the deliverable for review)
    - [ ]  Is the UTP traceable to the Low Level Design?
    - [ ]  Does each function have a minimum of one test case?
    - [ ]  Is the plan for test coverage (GCOV, ATAC tools â€“90%) done?
    - [ ]  Are all the compiler options that are to be used for building the software verified?
Is SDP for CUT studied?
  - [ ] **Safety Checks**
    - [ ] Is Statement coverage is 100% statisfied?
    - [ ] Is Branch Coverage is 100% statisfied?
